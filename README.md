Code for [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) model described in [Nolting et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2015.03.002). 

Results in the paper were generated using NetLogo 4.1.3. At some point (before using git), model was updated to work with NetLogo 5.3.1, but I don't remember what changes were required.

### To do
* Re-factor code so that variable names, etc. match terminology used in the paper
* Fill out fields on Info tab
* Make superficial changes to make model more intuitive to use
